  <p> This Intercom Subscription Terms of Service ("<strong>Agreement</strong>") is entered into by and between the Intercom entity set forth below ("<strong>Intercom</strong>") and the entity or person placing an order for or accessing any Services ("<strong>Customer</strong>" or "<strong>you</strong>"). If you are accessing or using the Services on behalf of your company, you represent that you are authorized to accept this Agreement on behalf of your company, and all references to "you" or "Customer" reference your company. </p>
  <p> This Agreement permits Customer to purchase subscriptions to online software-as-a-service products and other services from Intercom pursuant to any Intercom ordering documents, online registration, order descriptions or order confirmations referencing this Agreement ("<strong>Order Form(s)</strong>") and sets forth the basic terms and conditions under which those products and services will be delivered. This Agreement will govern Customer's initial purchase on the Effective Date as well as any future purchases made by Customer that reference this Agreement. </p>
  <p> The "<strong>Effective Date</strong>" of this Agreement is the date which is the earlier of (a) Customer's initial access to any Service (as defined below) through any online provisioning, registration or order process or (b) the effective date of the first Order Form referencing this Agreement. </p>
  <p> As used in this Agreement, "Intercom" means (a) Intercom, Inc., a Delaware corporation with offices at 55 2<sup>nd</sup> Street, 4<sup>th</sup> Fl., San Francisco, CA 94105, USA, if Customer's billing address on the applicable Order Form is located in the states of Alabama, Georgia, Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, or Pennsylvania; or (b) Intercom R&amp;D Unlimited Company, an Irish company with offices at 2<sup>nd</sup> Floor, Stephen Court, 18-21 St. Stephen's Green, Dublin 2, Republic of Ireland, if Customer's billing address on the applicable Order Form is located anywhere else in the world. </p>
  <p> <strong>Modifications to this Agreement</strong> : From time to time, Intercom may modify this Agreement. Unless otherwise specified by Intercom, changes become effective for Customer upon renewal of Customer's current Subscription Term (as defined below) or entry into a new Order Form. Intercom will use reasonable efforts to notify Customer of the changes through communications via Customer's account, email or other means. Customer may be required to click to accept or otherwise agree to the modified Agreement before renewing a Subscription Term or entering into a new Order Form, and in any event continued use of the Services after the updated version of this Agreement goes into effect will constitute Customer's acceptance of such updated version. If Intercom specifies that changes to the Agreement will take effect prior to Customer's next renewal or order (such as for legal compliance or product change reasons) and Customer objects to such changes, Customer may terminate the applicable Subscription Term and receive as its sole remedy a refund of any fees Customer has pre-paid for use of the applicable Services for the terminated portion of the Subscription Term. </p>
  <p> <strong> BY INDICATING YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ACCESSING OR USING ANY SERVICES, YOU ARE AGREEING TO BE BOUND BY ALL TERMS, CONDITIONS, AND NOTICES CONTAINED OR REFERENCED IN THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS AGREEMENT, PLEASE DO NOT USE ANY SERVICES. FOR CLARITY, EACH PARTY EXPRESSLY AGREES THAT THIS AGREEMENT IS LEGALLY BINDING UPON IT. THIS AGREEMENT CONTAINS MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISIONS THAT REQUIRE THE USE OF ARBITRATION TO RESOLVE DISPUTES, RATHER THAN JURY TRIALS. PLEASE READ IT CAREFULLY. </strong></p>

  <div class="terms__policy-subheading">14. Indemnification</div>
  <p> Intercom will defend Customer from and against any claim by a third party alleging that a Service when used as authorized under this Agreement infringes a U.S. patent, U.S. copyright, or U.S. trademark and will indemnify and hold harmless Customer from and against any damages and costs finally awarded against Customer or agreed in settlement by Intercom (including reasonable attorneys' fees) resulting from such claim, provided that Intercom will have received from Customer: (i) prompt written notice of such claim (but in any event notice in sufficient time for Intercom to respond without prejudice); (ii) the exclusive right to control and direct the investigation, defense and settlement (if applicable) of such claim; and (iii) all reasonable necessary cooperation of Customer. If Customer's use of a Service is (or in Intercom's opinion is likely to be) enjoined, if required by settlement or if Intercom determines such actions are reasonably necessary to avoid material liability, Intercom may, in its sole discretion: (a) substitute substantially functionally similar products or services; (b) procure for Customer the right to continue using such Service; or if (a) and (b) are not commercially reasonable, (c) terminate this Agreement and refund to Customer the fees paid by Customer for the portion of the Subscription Term that was paid by Customer but not rendered by Intercom. The foregoing indemnification obligation of Intercom will not apply: (1) if such Service is modified by any party other than Intercom, but solely to the extent the alleged infringement is caused by such modification; (2) if such Service is combined with products or processes not provided by Intercom, but solely to the extent the alleged infringement is caused by such combination; (3) to any unauthorized use of such Service; (4) to any action arising as a result of Customer Data or any third-party deliverables or components contained within such Service; (5) to the extent the alleged infringement is not caused by the particular technology or implementation of the Service but instead by features common to any similar product or service; or (6) if Customer settles or makes any admissions with respect to a claim without Intercom's prior written consent. THIS SECTION 14 SETS FORTH Intercom's AND ITS SUPPLIERS' SOLE LIABILITY AND CUSTOMER'S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY WITH RESPECT TO ANY CLAIM OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT.</p>

<div id="terms_confidential-information">
  <div class="sp__2"></div>
  <div class="terms__policy-subheading">15. Confidential Information</div>
  <p> Each party (as "<strong>Receiving Party</strong>") agrees that all code, inventions, know-how, business, technical and financial information it obtains from the disclosing party ("<strong>Disclosing Party</strong>") constitute the confidential property of the Disclosing Party ("<strong>Confidential Information</strong>"), provided that it is identified as confidential at the time of disclosure or should be reasonably known by the Receiving Party to be confidential or proprietary due to the nature of the information disclosed and the circumstances surrounding the disclosure. Any Intercom Technology, performance information relating to any Service, and the terms and conditions of this Agreement will be deemed Confidential Information of Intercom without any marking or further designation. Except as expressly authorized herein, the Receiving Party will (1) hold in confidence and not disclose any Confidential Information to third parties and (2) not use Confidential Information for any purpose other than fulfilling its obligations and exercising its rights under this Agreement. The Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information to its employees, agents, contractors and other representatives having a legitimate need to know (including, for Intercom, the subcontractors referenced in Section 17.8 (Subcontractors)), provided that such representatives are bound to confidentiality obligations no less protective of the Disclosing Party than this Section 15 and that the Receiving Party remains responsible for compliance by any such representative with the terms of this Section 15. The Receiving Party's confidentiality obligations will not apply to information that the Receiving Party can document: (i) was rightfully in its possession or known to it prior to receipt of the Confidential Information; (ii) is or has become public knowledge through no fault of the Receiving Party; (iii) is rightfully obtained by the Receiving Party from a third party without breach of any confidentiality obligation; or (iv) is independently developed by employees of the Receiving Party who had no access to such information. The Receiving Party may make disclosures to the extent required by law or court order, provided the Receiving Party notifies the Disclosing Party in advance and cooperates in any effort to obtain confidential treatment. The Receiving Party acknowledges that disclosure of Confidential Information would cause substantial harm for which damages alone would not be a sufficient remedy, and therefore that upon any such disclosure by the Receiving Party the Disclosing Party will be entitled to seek appropriate equitable relief in addition to whatever other remedies it might have at law. </p>

<div id="terms_general">
  <div class="sp__2"></div>
  <div class="terms__policy-subheading">17. General Terms</div>
  <p> 17.1. <strong>Assignment</strong> . This Agreement will bind and inure to the benefit of each party's permitted successors and assigns. Neither party may assign this Agreement without the advance written consent of the other party, except that either party may assign this Agreement in connection with a merger, reorganization, acquisition or other transfer of all or substantially all of such party's assets or voting securities. Any attempt to transfer or assign this Agreement except as expressly authorized under this Section 17.1 will be null and void. </p>
  <p> 17.2. <strong>Severability</strong>. If any provision of this Agreement will be adjudged by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement will otherwise remain in effect. </p>
  <p> 17.3. <strong>Governing Law; Dispute Resolution</strong>. </p>
  <p> a) <u>Direct Dispute Resolution</u>. In the event of any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement arising from or relating to this Agreement, whether arising in contract, tort or otherwise, ("<strong>Dispute</strong>"), the parties shall first use their best efforts to resolve the Dispute. If a Dispute arises, the complaining party shall provide written notice to the other party in a document specifically entitled "Initial Notice of Dispute," specifically setting forth the precise nature of the dispute ("<strong>Initial Notice of Dispute</strong>"). If an Initial Notice of Dispute is being sent to Intercom it must be emailed to legal@intercom.io and sent via mail to: </p>
  <p> Attn: Legal Department<br/>
    Intercom<br/>
    55 Second Street, Suite 400<br/>
    San Francisco, CA 94105
  </p>
  <p> Following receipt of the Initial Notice of Dispute, the parties shall consult and negotiate with each other in good faith and, recognizing their mutual interest, attempt to reach a just and equitable solution of the Dispute that is satisfactory to both parties ("<strong>Direct Dispute Resolution</strong>"). If the parties are unable to reach a resolution of the Dispute through Direct Dispute Resolution within thirty (30) days of the receipt of the Initial Notice of Dispute, then the Dispute shall subsequently be resolved by arbitration as set forth below. </p>
  <p> b) <u>Arbitration</u>. IN THE EVENT THAT A DISPUTE BETWEEN THE PARTIES CANNOT BE SETTLED THROUGH DIRECT DISPUTE RESOLUTION, AS DESCRIBED ABOVE, THE PARTIES AGREE TO SUBMIT THE DISPUTE TO BINDING ARBITRATION. BY AGREEING TO ARBITRATE, THE PARTIES AGREE TO WAIVE THEIR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL. The arbitration shall be conducted before a single neutral arbitrator, before JAMS in San Francisco, California. The arbitration shall be administered by JAMS in accordance with this document and the JAMS Streamlined Rules and Procedures for the Arbitration, with one addition: The limitation of one discovery deposition per side shall be applied by the arbitrator, unless it is determined, based on all relevant circumstances, that more depositions are warranted. The arbitrator shall consider the amount in controversy, the complexity of the factual issues, the number of parties and the diversity of their interests and whether any or all of the claims appear, on the basis of the pleadings, to have sufficient merit to justify the time and expense associated with the requested discovery. </p>
  <p> The arbitration will occur in San Francisco, California, but the parties may choose to appear by person, by phone, by another virtual means, or through the submission of documents. </p>
  <p> The arbitrator will issue a ruling in writing. Any issue concerning the extent to which any dispute is subject to arbitration, the applicability, interpretation, or enforceability of this agreement shall be resolved by the arbitrator. To the extent state law is applicable, the arbitrator shall apply the substantive law of California. </p>
  <p> All aspects of the arbitration shall be treated as confidential and neither the parties nor the arbitrators may disclose the content or results of the arbitration, except as necessary to comply with legal or regulatory requirements. The result of the arbitration shall be binding on the parties and judgment on the arbitrator's award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. The arbitrator shall award to the prevailing party, if any, the costs and attorneys' fees reasonably incurred by the prevailing party in connection with the arbitration. </p>
  <p> c) <u>Choice of Law and Jurisdiction</u>. FOR ANY CLAIM WHICH IS NOT SUBJECT TO THIS DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISION, CUSTOMER AGREES TO SUBMIT AND CONSENT TO THE PERSONAL AND EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION IN, AND THE EXCLUSIVE VENUE OF, THE STATE AND FEDERAL COURTS LOCATED WITHIN SAN FRANCISCO COUNTY, CALIFORNIA. IN ANY DISPUTE, CALIFORNIA LAW SHALL APPLY. </p>
  <p> d) <u>Construction and Joinder</u>. THIS AGREEMENT MUST BE CONSTRUED AS IF IT WAS JOINTLY WRITTEN BY BOTH PARTIES. BOTH CUSTOMER AND INTERCOM AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING OR PARTICIPATE IN CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN THEIR RESPECTIVE INDIVIDUAL CAPACITIES, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS. NO ARBITRATION OR CLAIM UNDER THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE JOINED TO ANY OTHER ARBITRATION OR CLAIM, INCLUDING ANY ARBITRATION OR CLAIM INVOLVING ANY OTHER CURRENT OR FORMER USER OF THE SERVICES, AND NO CLASS ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS SHALL BE PERMITTED. IN THE EVENT OF ANY DISPUTE CONCERNING THE VALIDITY OR ENFORCEABILITY OF THIS PROVISION, SUCH CLAIM MUST BE ADJUDICATED BY A COURT AND NOT BY AN ARBITRATOR. </p>
  <p> e) <u>Injunctive Relief</u>. Notwithstanding the above provisions, Intercom may apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction. </p>
  <p> 17.4. <strong>Notice</strong>. Any notice or communication required or permitted under this Agreement will be in writing to the parties at the addresses set forth on the Order Form or at such other address as may be given in writing by either party to the other in accordance with this Section and will be deemed to have been received by the addressee (i) if given by hand, immediately upon receipt; (ii) if given by overnight courier service, the first business day following dispatch or (iii) if given by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid and return receipt requested, the second business day after such notice is deposited in the mail. </p>
  <p> 17.5. <strong>Amendments; Waivers</strong>. Except as otherwise provided herein, no supplement, modification, or amendment of this Agreement will be binding, unless executed in writing by a duly authorized representative of each party to this Agreement. No waiver will be implied from conduct or failure to enforce or exercise rights under this Agreement, nor will any waiver be effective unless in a writing signed by a duly authorized representative on behalf of the party claimed to have waived. No provision of any purchase order or other business form employed by Customer will supersede the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and any such document relating to this Agreement will be for administrative purposes only and will have no legal effect. </p>
  <p> 17.6. <strong>Entire Agreement</strong>. This Agreement is the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding of the parties and supersedes and cancels all previous written and oral agreements and communications relating to the subject matter of this Agreement. Customer acknowledges that the Services are on-line, subscription-based products, and that in order to provide improved customer experience Intercom may make changes to the Services, and Intercom will update the applicable Documentation accordingly. The support and service level availability terms described in the Support Policy and the SLA may be updated from time to time upon reasonable notice to Customer to reflect process improvements or changing practices (but the modifications will not materially decrease Intercom's obligations as compared to those reflected in such terms as of the Effective Date). </p>
  <p> 17.7. <strong>Force Majeure</strong>. Neither party will be liable to the other for any delay or failure to perform any obligation under this Agreement (except for a failure to pay fees) if the delay or failure is due to unforeseen events that occur after the signing of this Agreement and that are beyond the reasonable control of such party, such as a strike, blockade, war, act of terrorism, riot, natural disaster, failure or diminishment of power or telecommunications or data networks or services, or refusal of a license by a government agency. </p>
  <p> 17.8. <strong>Subcontractors</strong> . Intercom may use the services of subcontractors and permit them to exercise the rights granted to Intercom in order to provide the Services under this Agreement, provided that Intercom remains responsible for (i) compliance of any such subcontractor with the terms of this Agreement and (ii) for the overall performance of the Services as required under this Agreement. </p>
  <p> 17.9. <strong>Subpoenas</strong>. Nothing in this Agreement prevents Intercom from disclosing Customer Data to the extent required by law, subpoenas, or court orders, but Intercom will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify Customer where permitted to do so. </p>
  <p> 17.10. <strong>Independent Contractors</strong>. The parties to this Agreement are independent contractors. There is no relationship of partnership, joint venture, employment, franchise or agency created hereby between the parties. Neither party will have the power to bind the other or incur obligations on the other party's behalf without the other party's prior written consent </p>
  <p> 17.11. <strong>Export Control</strong>. In its use of the Services, Customer agrees to comply with all export and import laws and regulations of the United States and other applicable jurisdictions. Without limiting the foregoing, (i) Customer represents and warrants that it is not listed on any U.S. government list of prohibited or restricted parties or located in (or a national of) a country that is subject to a U.S. government embargo or that has been designated by the U.S. government as a "terrorist supporting" country, (ii) Customer will not (and will not permit any of its users to) access or use the Services in violation of any U.S. export embargo, prohibition or restriction, and (iii) Customer will not submit to the Services any information that is controlled under the U.S. International Traffic in Arms Regulations </p>
  <p> 17.12. <strong>Government End-Users</strong>. Elements of the Services are commercial computer software. If the user or licensee of the Services is an agency, department, or other entity of the United States Government, the use, duplication, reproduction, release, modification, disclosure, or transfer of the Services, or any related documentation of any kind, including technical data and manuals, is restricted by a license agreement or by the terms of this Agreement in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 12.212 for civilian purposes and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement 227.7202 for military purposes. All Services were developed fully at private expense. All other use is prohibited </p>
  <p> 17.13. <strong>Counterparts.</strong> This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original and all of which together will be considered one and the same agreement. </p>

  <div class="terms__policy-subheading">Overview</div>
  <p>At Intercom we take the protection of customer data extremely seriously. This Intercom Security Policy describes the organizational and technical measures Intercom implements platform wide designed to prevent unauthorized access, use, alteration or disclosure of customer data. The Intercom services operate on Amazon Web Services (“AWS”); this policy describes activities of Intercom within its instance on AWS unless otherwise specified. As you continue to learn more about Intercom we recommend you also review our <a href="#terms">Terms of Service</a> and <a href="#privacy">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
</div>

<div id="security_team">
  <div class="sp__2"></div>
  <div class="terms__policy-subheading">Security Team</div>
  <p>Our infrastructure and security team includes people who’ve played lead roles in designing, building, and operating highly secure Internet facing systems at companies ranging from startups to large public companies.</p>
</div>

<div id="security_best-practices">
  <div class="sp__2"></div>
  <div class="terms__policy-subheading">Best Practices</div>
  <p>Incident Response Plan</p>
  <ul>
    <li>We have implemented a formal procedure for security events and have educated all our staff on our policies.</li>
    <li>When security events are detected they are escalated to our emergency alias, teams are paged, notified and assembled to rapidly address the event.</li>
    <li>After a security event is fixed we write up a post-mortem analysis.</li>
    <li>The analysis is reviewed in person, distributed across the company and includes action items that will make the detection and prevention of a similar event easier in the future.</li>
    <li>Intercom will promptly notify you in writing upon verification of a security breach of the Intercom services that affects your data. Notification will describe the breach and the status of Intercom’s investigation.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Build Process Automation</p>
  <ul>
    <li>We have functioning, frequently used automation in place so that we can safely and reliably rollout changes to both our application and operating platform within minutes.</li>
    <li>We typically deploy code dozens of times a day, so we have high confidence that we can get a security fix out quickly when required.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div id="security_infrastructure">
  <div class="sp__2"></div>
  <div class="terms__policy-subheading">Infrastructure</div>
  <ul>
    <li>All of our services run in the cloud. Intercom does not run our own routers, load balancers, DNS servers, or physical servers.</li>
    <li>All of our services and data are hosted in AWS facilities in the USA and protected by AWS security, as described at <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/security/sharing-the-security-responsibility">http://aws.amazon.com/security/sharing-the-security-responsibility</a>. Intercom services have been built with disaster recovery in mind.</li>
    <li>All of our infrastructure is spread across 3 AWS data centers (availability zones) and will continue to work should any one of those data centers fail unexpectedly. Amazon does not disclose the location of its data centers. As such, Intercom builds on the physical security and environmental controls provided by AWS. See <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/security">http://aws.amazon.com/security</a> for details of AWS security infrastructure.</li>
    <li>All of our servers are within our own virtual private cloud (VPC) with network access control lists (ACL’s) that prevent unauthorized requests getting to our internal network.</li>
    <li>Intercom uses a backup solution for datastores that contain customer data.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div id="security_data">
  <div class="sp__2"></div>
  <div class="terms__policy-subheading">Data</div>
  <ul>
    <li>All customer data is stored in the USA.</li>
    <li>Customer data is stored in multi-tenant datastores; we do not have individual datastores for each customer. However strict privacy controls exist in our application code that are designed to ensure data privacy and to prevent one customer from accessing another customer’s data (i.e., logical separation). We have many unit and integration tests in place to ensure these privacy controls work as expected. These tests are run every time our codebase is updated and even one single test failing will prevent new code being shipped to production.</li>
    <li>Each Intercom system used to process customer data is adequately configured and pathed using commercially-reasonable methods according to industry-recognized system-hardening standards.</li>
    <li>Intercom engages certain subprocessors to process customer data. These subprocessors are listed at <a href="#security-third-parties">security-third-parties</a>, as may be updated by Intercom from time to time.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div id="security_data-transfer">
  <div class="sp__2"></div>
  <div class="terms__policy-subheading">Data Transfer</div>
  <ul>
    <li>All data sent to or from Intercom is encrypted in transit using 256-bit encryption.</li>
    <li>Our API and application endpoints are TLS/SSL only and score an "A+" rating on SSL Labs' tests. This means we only use strong cipher suites and have features such as HSTS and Perfect Forward Secrecy fully enabled.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div id="security_authentication">
  <div class="sp__2"></div>
  <div class="terms__policy-subheading">Authentication</div>
  <ul>
    <li>Intercom is served 100% over https. Intercom runs a zero-trust corporate network.</li>
    <li>There are no corporate resources or additional privileges from being on Intercom’s network.</li>
    <li>We have two-factor authentication (2FA) and strong password policies on GitHub, Google, AWS MongoDB and Intercom to ensure access to cloud services are protected.</li>
  </ul>

<div id="security_permissions">
  <div class="sp__2"></div>
  <div class="terms__policy-subheading">Permissions and Admin Controls</div>

<div id="security_monitoring">
  <div class="sp__2"></div>
  <div class="terms__policy-subheading">Application Monitoring</div>
  <ul>
    <li>On an application level, we produce audit logs for all activity, ship logs to our service providers for analysis, and use S3/Glacier for archival purposes.</li>
    <li>All access to Intercom applications is logged and audited.</li>
    <li>Bastion hosts are used to login to devices.</li>

  <div class="terms__policy-subheading">Security Audits and Certifications</div>
  <ul>
    <li>We bi-annually engage with well-regarded third-party auditors to audit our code-base, and work with them to resolve potential issues.</li>
    <li>We use technologies to provide an audit trail over our infrastructure and the Intercom application. Auditing allows us to do ad-hoc security analysis, track changes made to our setup and audit access to every layer of our stack.</li>
    <li>Information about AWS security certifications and obtaining copies of security reports from AWS is available at <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/compliance/pci-data-privacy-protection-hipaa-soc-fedramp-faqs/">http://aws.amazon.com/compliance/pci-data-privacy-protection-hipaa-soc-fedramp-faqs/</a></li>

  <ol type="a">
    <li>
      <p> Direct Dispute Resolution. In the event of any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement arising from or relating to these Terms, whether arising in contract, tort or otherwise, (<strong>"Dispute"</strong>), the parties shall first use their best efforts to resolve the Dispute. If a Dispute arises, the complaining party shall provide written notice to the other party in a document specifically entitled <strong>"Initial Notice of Dispute,"</strong> specifically setting forth the precise nature of the dispute (<strong>"Initial Notice of Dispute"</strong>). If an Initial Notice of Dispute is being sent to Intercom it must be emailed to         <a href="mailto:legal@intercom.io">legal@intercom.io</a> and sent via mail to: </p>
      <p>
        Attn: Legal Department<br/>
        Intercom, Inc.<br/>
        55 2nd St., 4th Fl.<br/>
        San Francisco, CA 94105
      </p>
      <p> YOU AGREE THAT IF YOU WANT TO RESOLVE A DISPUTE WITH INTERCOM, YOU MUST SEND AN INITIAL NOTICE OF DISPUTE WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE EVENT THAT GAVE RISE TO THE DISPUTE. OTHERWISE, YOUR DISPUTE WILL BE PERMANENTLY BARRED. </p>
      <p> Following receipt of the Initial Notice of Dispute, the parties shall consult and negotiate with each other in good faith and, recognizing their mutual interest, attempt to reach a just and equitable solution of the Dispute that is satisfactory to both parties (<strong>"Direct Dispute Resolution"</strong>). If the parties are unable to reach a resolution of the Dispute through Direct Dispute Resolution within thirty (30) days of the receipt of the Initial Notice of Dispute, then the Dispute shall subsequently be resolved by arbitration as set forth below. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p> Arbitration. IN THE EVENT THAT A DISPUTE BETWEEN THE PARTIES CANNOT BE SETTLED THROUGH DIRECT DISPUTE RESOLUTION, AS DESCRIBED ABOVE, THE PARTIES AGREE TO SUBMIT THE DISPUTE TO BINDING ARBITRATION. BY AGREEING TO ARBITRATE, THE PARTIES AGREE TO WAIVE THEIR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL. The arbitration shall be conducted before a single neutral arbitrator, before JAMS in San Francisco, California. The arbitration shall be administered by JAMS in accordance with this document and the JAMS Streamlined Rules and Procedures for the Arbitration, with one addition: The limitation of one discovery deposition per side shall be applied by the arbitrator, unless it is determined, based on all relevant circumstances, that more depositions are warranted. The arbitrator shall consider the amount in controversy, the complexity of the factual issues, the number of parties and the diversity of their interests and whether any or all of the claims appear, on the basis of the pleadings, to have sufficient merit to justify the time and expense associated with the requested discovery. </p>
      <p> The arbitration will occur in San Francisco, California, but the parties may choose to appear by person, by phone, by another virtual means, or through the submission of documents. </p>
      <p>
        The arbitrator will issue a ruling in writing. Any issue concerning the
        extent to which any dispute is subject to arbitration, the applicability,
        interpretation, or enforceability of these Terms shall be resolved by the
        arbitrator. To the extent state law is applicable, the arbitrator shall
        apply the substantive law of California.
      </p>
      <p> All aspects of the arbitration shall be treated as confidential and neither the parties nor the arbitrators may disclose the content or results of the arbitration, except as necessary to comply with legal or regulatory requirements. The result of the arbitration shall be binding on the parties and judgment on the arbitrator's award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. The arbitrator shall award to the prevailing party, if any, the costs and attorneys' fees reasonably incurred by the prevailing party in connection with the arbitration. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p> Choice of Law and Jurisdiction. FOR ANY CLAIM WHICH IS NOT SUBJECT TO THIS DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISION, YOU AGREE TO SUBMIT AND CONSENT TO THE PERSONAL AND EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION IN, AND THE EXCLUSIVE VENUE OF, THE STATE AND FEDERAL COURTS LOCATED WITHIN SAN FRANCISCO COUNTY, CALIFORNIA. IN ANY DISPUTE, CALIFORNIA LAW SHALL APPLY. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p> Construction and Joinder. THESE TERMS MUST BE CONSTRUED AS IF THEY WERE JOINTLY WRITTEN BY BOTH PARTIES. BOTH YOU AND INTERCOM AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING OR PARTICIPATE IN CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN THEIR RESPECTIVE INDIVIDUAL CAPACITIES, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS. NO ARBITRATION OR CLAIM UNDER THESE TERMS SHALL BE JOINED TO ANY OTHER ARBITRATION OR CLAIM, INCLUDING ANY ARBITRATION OR CLAIM INVOLVING ANY OTHER CURRENT OR FORMER USER OF THE SITE, AND NO CLASS ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS SHALL BE PERMITTED. IN THE EVENT OF ANY DISPUTE CONCERNING THE VALIDITY OR ENFORCEABILITY OF THIS PROVISION, SUCH CLAIM MUST BE ADJUDICATED BY A COURT AND NOT BY AN ARBITRATOR. </p>

  <div class="terms__policy-subheading">General Terms</div>
  <p> These Terms, together with our Privacy Policy and any other notices or policies we have published on the Site (and additional terms for specific features or areas, as applicable), constitute the entire agreement between you and us regarding this Site. If a court having proper authority decides that any portion of these Terms is invalid, only the part that is invalid will not apply. The rest of these Terms will still be in effect. If we waive any of our rights under these Terms in any particular instance, it does not mean that we are waiving our rights generally or in the future. Furthermore, just because we may not enforce all our rights all of the time, it does not mean that we are waiving our rights. We may decide to enforce them at a later date. These Terms, and any rights and licenses granted under these Terms, may not be transferred or assigned by you except as expressly set forth herein, but may be assigned by us without restriction. We won't be liable to you for any delay or failure to perform any obligation we have under these Terms if the delay or failure is due to events which are beyond our reasonable control, including but not limited to any strike, blockade, war, act of terrorism, riot, natural disaster, failure or diminishment of power or of telecommunications or data networks or services, or refusal of approval or a license by a government agency. </p>

<p> This Intercom Service Level Agreement ("SLA") accompanies the Intercom Subscription Terms of Service, available at <a href="#terms"> https://intercom.com/terms-of-service </a> or a successor URL (the "Agreement") entered into between you ("Customer") and Intercom. Capitalized terms used in this SLA that are not defined herein have the meanings given to them in the Agreement. </p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p> <strong>Target Availability.</strong> Intercom will use commercially reasonable efforts to make each Service available with an uptime of 99.8% of each calendar month ("Target Availability"). </p>
    </li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
    <li>
        <p><strong>Exclusions.</strong> The calculation of uptime will not include unavailability to the extent due to: (a) use of the Service by Customer in a manner not authorized in this Agreement or the applicable Documentation; (b) general Internet problems, force majeure events or other factors outside of Intercom's reasonable control; (c) Customer's equipment, software, network connections or other infrastructure; (d) third party systems, acts or omissions; or (e) Scheduled Maintenance or reasonable emergency maintenance. </p>
    </li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
    <li>
        <p> <strong>Scheduled Maintenance.</strong> "Scheduled Maintenance" means Intercom's scheduled routine maintenance of the Services for which Intercom notifies Customer at least twenty-four (24) hours in advance. Scheduled Maintenance will not exceed eight (8) hours per month. Intercom typically performs Scheduled Maintenance once per month. </p>
    </li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
    <li>
        <p> <strong>Remedy for Failure to Meet Target Availability.</strong> If there is a verified failure of a Service to meet Target Availability in two (2) consecutive months, then Customer may terminate the applicable Subscription Term by sending written notice of termination within thirty (30) days after the end of the second such month, in which case Intercom will refund to Customer any fees Customer has pre-paid for use of such Service for the terminated portion of the applicable Subscription Term. This termination and refund right is Customer's sole and exclusive remedy, and Intercom's sole and exclusive liability, for Intercom's failure to meet the Target Availability. </p>

If you are a tax-exempt entity or claims exemption from any Taxes under this Agreement, you shall provide a certificate of exemption upon execution of this Agreement and, after receipt of valid evidence of exemption, Intercom shall not charge you any Taxes from which it is exempt. Without limiting the foregoing, all references to payments made in this Agreement are exclusive of any VAT, GST or other consumption taxes (collectively, “VAT”) chargeable and where required by law, VAT shall be itemized at the rate applicable, if any, and paid in addition thereto. You shall communicate to Intercom your VAT identification number(s) attributed by (i) the country where you have established your business, and/or (ii) any other country where you have established a fixed establishment, to which the Services under this Agreement are provided.

You shall comply with all applicable tax laws and regulations, and you shall provide Intercom all necessary assistance to facilitate the recovery or refund of any VAT paid by Intercom in relation to the Services to the respective government or authority. You hereby agree to indemnify Intercom for any Taxes and related costs paid or payable by Intercom attributable to Taxes that would have been your responsibility under this section if invoiced to you. You shall promptly pay or reimburse Intercom for all costs and damages related to any liability incurred by Intercom as a result of your non-compliance or delay with its responsibilities herein. Your obligation under this section shall survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement.</p>

Upon termination of your account, your right to use the Services, access the Website, and any Content will immediately cease. All provisions of this Agreement which, by their nature, should survive termination, shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, and limitations of liability.</p>
<p><b>18. MISCELLANEOUS.</b> The failure of either party to exercise, in any respect, any right provided for herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder. If any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. This Agreement is not assignable, transferable or sublicensable by you except with Intercom’s prior written consent. Intercom may transfer, assign or delegate this Agreement and its rights and obligations without consent. No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment is created as a result of this Agreement and you do not have any authority of any kind to bind Intercom in any respect whatsoever. Headings for each section have been included above for your convenience, but such headings do not have any legal meaning, and may not accurately reflect the content of the provisions they precede.</p>
